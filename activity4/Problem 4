Problem 4: Bulk Purchase Discount

Problem:
Customers get discounts based on how many cups they buy:
1–4 cups: No discount
5–9 cups: 10% discount
10+ cups: 20% discount
Each cup is $1.

Task:

Write a program that:
Ask how many cups the customer wants.
Calculates the total cost with the correct discount.
Outputs the final price.

Sample Input:
How many cups? 7

Sample Output:
Total cost: $6.30
==================================================================
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
   float cups, product, result;
   
   
   cout<<"how many cups?";
   cin>> cups;                    Uncomplete
   
   switch( )
   product = cups * 0.10;
   result = cups - product;
   cout<< result;
  return 0;
 
}
