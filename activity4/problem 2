/*Problem 2: Weather-Based Discounts

Problem:
You want to attract more customers. If it’s hot (temperature is 30°C or more), offer a 20% discount.

Task:
Write a program that:
Ask for the temperature.

Sets the price to:
$0.80 if temperature >= 30
$1.00 otherwise
Outputs the final price.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int temperature;
    char move;
    do{ // instruction where the loop starts
    cout<<"enter temperature: ";//input
    cin>> temperature;
    if (temperature >= 30){//condition of greater than or equal 30
       cout<<"It's hot! Lemonade costs $0.80 today."<<endl;//output
    }
    else{
        cout<<"$1.00"<<endl;//output
    }
    cout<< "Do you want to try agian?(y/n) ";
    cin>> move;
  }//loop ends here
   while (move == 'y'|| move == 'Y'); //loop
    return 0;
}
