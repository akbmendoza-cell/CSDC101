/*Problem 3: Inventory Check

Problem:
You can only sell lemonade if you have lemons and sugar.

Task:
Write a program that:

Ask the user how many lemons and how many cups of sugar they have.
If either lemons or sugar is 0 or less, 
	output: "You can't make lemonade!"
Otherwise,
	output: "You're ready to sell lemonade!"

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int lemon, sugar ;
    char move;
    do{
    cout<<"how many lemons?: ";//input
    cin>> lemon;
    cout<<"how many sugar?: ";//input
    cin>> sugar;
    if (lemon <= 0 || sugar <= 0){//condition of if lemon is less than or equal 0 or sugar is less than or equal 0
       cout<<"you can't make lemonade!"<<endl;//output
    }
    else{
        cout<<"You're ready to sell lemonade!"<<endl;//output
    }
    cout<< "Do you want to try again? (y/n) ";

    while ( move == 'y' || move == 'Y');
